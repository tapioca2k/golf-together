# Golf Together
Golf Together is a client/server application designed for multiplayer golf video games. You can play using course data for any video game. The lobby itself can host as many players as the host's PC will allow connections for. The leaderboard updates automatically and can show anywhere from 1-16 players at a time.  It will automatically scroll through the entire leaderboard regardless of how many players you wish to see at a time. Invite your friends to turn any golf video game into an online multiplayer game with Golf Together. Use the leaderboard as a source on stream to show your viewers the scores in real time.
